# 🧠 Learn Go with CLI Tools

Welcome to my personal Go learning playground! This repository is a beginner-focused collection of small command-line tools — starting with a calculator — to explore and practice **Go (Golang)** syntax, types, and control structures.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project is my hands-on journey into learning Go, built around the philosophy of **"learn by building"**. Each tool in this repo is designed to reinforce my understanding of:

- ✅ Go's basic syntax and structure
- ✅ Primitive types and custom types
- ✅ Conditional logic and control flow
- ✅ Functions and error handling
- ✅ Working with standard I/O and CLI interaction

## 📦 Tools Built So Far

- **🧮 Calculator CLI**
  - A simple command-line calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations.
  - Helps reinforce type handling, control flow, and user input in Go.

_Stay tuned for more tools as I continue learning!_

## 🛠 How to Run

Make sure you have Go installed. Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosnyik/go-calculator.git
cd go-calculator
go run calculator.go

```
## What I'm Learning
This repository tracks my progress as I explore:

Variables and constants

Data types and conversion

If/else and switch statements

Loops (for)

Functions and return values

Error handling (error type)

Basic input/output with fmt and bufio

## Why I Built This
Go is known for its simplicity, speed, and power. I'm using this repo to:

Learn Go fundamentals in a practical way

Document my learning process

Build a solid foundation for future Go projects

If you're new to Go too, feel free to follow along or fork the repo!
